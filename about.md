<p>Hi, I'm Brad! I'm a software developer living in Seattle and working at
Microsoft. I've worked at Microsoft since the summer of 2012 as a developer
on the Operating System Performance team. Before that, I was a student at 
Northwestern University where I majored in Computer Science and Economics.</p>

<p>I love software problems of all kinds, and I'm at home working anywhere
in the software stack. In my time at Microsoft, I've checked in code to 
the Xbox One hypervisor, the NT kernel, the HoloLens video capture pipeline, 
and the Windows Performance Analyzer just to give a few examples. As an
undergraduate, I also wrote a 
<a href="https://github.com/BradleyMarie/L5c">compiler</a>
and made contributions to projects as varied as the 
<a href="http://www.v3vee.org/palacios/">Palacios</a> hypervisor and the
<a href="http://omnipedia.northwestern.edu/">Omnipedia</a> client for 
Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending my free time skiing, hiking, traveling,
watching movies, and working on my 
<a href="https://github.com/BradleyMarie/Iris">ray tracer</a>.</p>
