<p>Hi, I'm Brad! I'm a software developer living in Seattle and working at
Microsoft. I've worked at Microsoft since the summer of 2012 as a developer
on the Operating System Performance team. Before that, I was a student at 
Northwestern University where I majored in Computer Science and Economics.</p>

<p>Since joining Microsoft, I've contributed code to a number of binaries 
throughout our stack including the Xbox hypervisor, the Windows Kernel,
the Hololens mixed reality compositor, and the Windows audio format converter
just to name a few. Additionally, I've also led investigations into the CPU, 
GPU, memory, and power usage of our applications. More details can be found
in my resume.</p>
